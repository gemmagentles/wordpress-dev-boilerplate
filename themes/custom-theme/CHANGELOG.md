### Website Changelog

#### Rules for filling in this Changelog ####
If you have cloned this repo to make a new site, remove the release list and add your own.

The release list must include;
* Most up to date release number and date of release added. 
* Underneath should list out the changes that are being pushed to that release.

Please note release number relevance. The first number = something new has been added. The second number = something has been changed. The third number = a hot fix had to be made. ie. something small was missed and it was released already, so lets make a quick fix to the release.
