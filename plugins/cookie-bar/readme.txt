Cookie Bar allows you to discreetly inform visitors that your website uses cookies.


== Description ==
A simple, lightweight WordPress plugin for displaying a discreet notification bar that is dismissable and the dismissal is saved by cookie. Perfect for implementing the EU cookie law (GDPR)!

<strong>The Cookie Bar plugin creates a small bar at the bottom of the website with a short customizable message about cookies and an accept button.</strong> Once a visitor has accepted the Cookie Bar, it then disappears.

Feel free to try out the plugin through our installation of <a href="https://www.brontobytes.com/blog/cookie-bar-free-wordpress-plugin/">Cookie Bar</a>.

Troubleshooting: If you or your visitors are using an adblocker that can block cookie bars, the bar may not show up. Whitelist your website in your adblocker's browser add-on/extension.


== Installation ==
Add the plugin by uploading the zip file to your WordPress admin area > Plugins > Add New or by installing it from the WordPress Plugin directory.
Activate the plugin and go to Settings > Cookie Bar.
Configure it as you would like.
Save.
That's all!
